# PitchDetector

A python program used to detect the fundamental frequency of a musical sound.
We are currently using the autocorrelation method to recognize the notes played.

A c# xamarin port for Android has been created that uses the Math.Net Numerics and Filtering libraries to do the necessary calculations. 

This program is developed to aid beginners who study the violin or any other instrument that hasn't an exact note mapping by showing them what notes they are actually playing.
